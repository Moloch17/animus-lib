 * A layout block: one group of observation features and actions of a class/role policy (the class's spells, the
 * duel's movement, the pack's enemy slots, ...). A stage is an ordered list of blocks (see StageDefinition), and a
 * layout places each block's features and actions after the previous block's (see Layout).
 *
 * Blocks are stateless: everything they read comes from the world and the SeatView, so the same code encodes a seat
 * in training and a companion in play.
