/*
 * The curriculum, a tree: every stage extends one earlier stage (and seeds from it), keeping the base's
 * blocks it needs and adding its own.
 *
 *   duel ─┬─ pack ─ gauntlet ─ companion ─ party ─┬─ crossroads     (PvE ...
 *         ├─ pvp ─ arena ─────────────────────────┘                  ... and PvP, merged)
 *         └─ travel ─┬─ flight                                       (getting somewhere)
 *                    └─ (with arena) flag                            (Warsong Gulch's rules)
 *
 * Scenario names carry the stage's number (stage1_duel ... stage8_crossroads), model names only its suffix (_duel). The
 * duel is the first stage: nothing seeds it.
 *
 * A stage's episodes are its arenas (see ArenaDefinition): each episode draws one by weight, so a stage can mix PvE
 * and PvP situations over the union of their blocks. Stages 1-7 have one arena each.
 *
 * Adding a stage is one entry here (plus new blocks or encounters only if it needs new features) and a learner
 * config, configs/<name>.yaml.
