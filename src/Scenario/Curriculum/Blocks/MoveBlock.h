    /// Every movement the curriculum had before this was target-relative: DuelBlock's MOVE_TO_TARGET, MOVE_TO_RANGE,
    /// MOVE_BEHIND, BACK_OFF, KEEP_RANGE, STAY_ON_TARGET and STOP all open with
    /// `if (!target || !target->IsAlive()) return false`, so a seat with nothing to fight could not move at all. The
    /// hazard drill found that the hard way: four million steps with allowed_actions at 1.00, entropy at 0 and the
    /// seats standing still while the fire burned them, until an unkillable emitter was handed to them purely so the
    /// movement actions would unmask. This block is what that hack was standing in for. It needs no target, no enemy
    /// and no objective -- only legs.
    ///
    /// **Bearings are egocentric and durative.** An action picks a compass point relative to where the seat is facing
    /// now (forward, forward-right, right, and so on round the eight), and the seat walks that way until it chooses
    /// otherwise. It is a held key, not a step: a decision is 250 ms of game time and a step measured in one would be
    /// a stutter, which is the same reason KEEP_RANGE is an option rather than a press. The destination is recomputed
    /// from the seat's current position each decision the bearing is held, so the path bends with the ground rather
    /// than aiming at a point chosen when the key went down.
    ///
    /// **Facing is chosen apart from movement**, which is what makes strafing and backpedalling expressible at all.
    /// A player can run one way and look another; a spline that sets its own orientation cannot. FACE_TARGET keeps
    /// the seat turned to what it is fighting while it moves anywhere, FACE_HEADING turns it the way it is going, and
    /// FACE_HOLD leaves it pointing where it already points. Combined with a bearing, those give every gait a player
    /// has: run in facing the enemy, circle it, back away still casting.
    ///
    /// **Resolution comes from the tick, not from more decisions.** AnimusForge.TicksPerDecision cuts a decision into
    /// several world updates, so a spline issued once per decision is still walked in fine steps by the world. Making
    /// the policy decide faster instead would cost an observation, a learner round trip and an action every time.
    ///
    /// This block does not replace the duel block's movement. Closing to melee reach and holding a caster's range are
    /// jobs about a target, and they read better as one action than as a bearing the policy has to steer. What this
